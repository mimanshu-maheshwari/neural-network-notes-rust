# Create a NN that morphs images: 

## Create a basic NN 
- a nn which acts like multiplier of 2
	- [x] test data
	- [x] cost function
	- [x] rate and epsilon Îµ
	- [x] finite differences
- a nn which acts like gates.
	- [x] and, or gate are one neuron 
	- zor gate is 2 input neuron 
- create a library to handle nn
- add sigmoid to cost function 
- create derivates for feed forward and back propogation
