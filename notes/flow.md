# Create a NN that morphs images:

## Create a basic NN

- [x] a nn which acts like multiplier of 2
  - [x] test data
  - [x] cost function
  - [x] rate and epsilon Îµ
  - [x] finite differences
- [x] a nn which acts like gates.
  - [x] and, or gate are one neuron
  - [x] zor gate is 2 input neuron
- [x] add sigmoid to cost function
- [x] create a library to handle nn
  - [x] create NNMatrix
  - [x] create NNArch
    - [x] create NNArch with just a few parameters (Abstraction of logic)
    - [x] move the learn(), finite_diff(), calc_cost() functions to lib
- [ ] create derivates for feed forward and back propogation
